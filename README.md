```

2. Restart ComfyUI - the nodes will automatically install VibeVoice on first use

### Manual Installation
If automatic installation fails:
```bash
cd ComfyUI
python_embeded/python.exe -m pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/VibeVoice.git
```

- **Output**: `audio` - Passes through the input audio unchanged
- **Use Case**: Insert between nodes to free VRAM/RAM at specific workflow points
- **Example**: `[VibeVoice Node] ‚Üí [Free Memory] ‚Üí [Save Audio]`

## Multi-Speaker Text Format

For multi-speaker generation, format your text using the `[N]:` notation:

```
[1]: Hello, how are you today?
[2]: I'm doing great, thanks for asking!
[1]: That's wonderful to hear.
[3]: Hey everyone, mind if I join the conversation?
[2]: Not at all, welcome!
```

**Important Notes:**
- Use `[1]:`, `[2]:`, `[3]:`, `[4]:` for speaker labels
- Maximum 4 speakers supported
- The system automatically detects the number of speakers from your text
- Each speaker can have an optional voice sample for cloning

## Model Information

### VibeVoice-1.5B
- **Size**: ~5GB download
- **Speed**: Faster inference
- **Quality**: Good for single speaker
- **Use Case**: Quick prototyping, single voices

### VibeVoice-7B-Preview
- **Size**: ~17GB download
- **Speed**: Slower inference
- **Quality**: Superior, especially for multi-speaker
- **Use Case**: Production quality, multi-speaker conversations

Models are automatically downloaded on first use and cached in `ComfyUI/models/vibevoice/`.

## Generation Modes

### Deterministic Mode (Default)
- `use_sampling = False`
- Produces consistent, stable output
- Recommended for production use

### Sampling Mode
- `use_sampling = True`
- More variation in output
- Uses temperature and top_p parameters
- Good for creative exploration

## Voice Cloning

To clone a voice:
1. Connect an audio node to the `voice_to_clone` input (single speaker)
2. Or connect to `speaker1_voice`, `speaker2_voice`, etc. (multi-speaker)
3. The model will attempt to match the voice characteristics

**Requirements for voice samples:**
- Clear audio with minimal background noise
- Minimum 3‚Äì10 seconds. Recommended at least 30 seconds for better quality
- Automatically resampled to 24kHz

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Text Preparation**:
   - Use proper punctuation for natural pauses
   - Break long texts into paragraphs
   - For multi-speaker, ensure clear speaker transitions

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Use 1.5B for quick single-speaker tasks
   - Use 7B for multi-speaker or when quality is priority

3. **Seed Management**:
   - Default seed (42) works well for most cases
   - Save good seeds for consistent character voices
   - Try random seeds if default doesn't work well

4. **Performance**:
   - First run downloads models (5-17GB)
   - Subsequent runs use cached models
   - GPU recommended for faster inference

## System Requirements

### Hardware
- **Minimum**: 8GB VRAM for VibeVoice-1.5B
- **Recommended**: 16GB+ VRAM for VibeVoice-7B
- **RAM**: 16GB+ system memory

### Software
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA 11.8+ (for GPU acceleration)
- ComfyUI (latest version)

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues
- Ensure you're using ComfyUI's Python environment
- Try manual installation if automatic fails
- Restart ComfyUI after installation

### Generation Issues
- If voices sound unstable, try deterministic mode
- For multi-speaker, ensure text has proper `[N]:` format
- Check that speaker numbers are sequential (1,2,3 not 1,3,5)

### Memory Issues
- 7B model requires ~16GB VRAM
- Use 1.5B model for lower VRAM systems
- Models use bfloat16 precision for efficiency

## Examples

### Single Speaker
```
Text: "Welcome to our presentation. Today we'll explore the fascinating world of artificial intelligence."
Model: VibeVoice-1.5B
cfg_scale: 1.3
use_sampling: False
```

### Two Speakers
```
[1]: Have you seen the new AI developments?
[2]: Yes, they're quite impressive!
[1]: I think voice synthesis has come a long way.
[2]: Absolutely, it sounds so natural now.
```

### Four Speaker Conversation
```
[1]: Welcome everyone to our meeting.
[2]: Thanks for having us!
[3]: Glad to be here.
[4]: Looking forward to the discussion.
[1]: Let's begin with the agenda.
```
